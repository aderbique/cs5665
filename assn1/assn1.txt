1. Route A: 80 highway - 395 highway - 44 highway with 37 towns along side.

Route B: 80 highway - 5 highway with 59 towns along side.

2. Route A looks like a better choice as it's a more direct route. Looking at the cameras, both routes appear to have flowing traffic.  The altitude gains and losses make route B look more desirable as well as less road construction on route B. That being said, It appears route A is going through the mountains whereas route B has more towns. (Could mean more traffic but could be the safer route to take).

Ability to avoid toll roads (There's several in California)

5. Data Science can prove useful in determining the best route to take. For instance, if you have a direct route but it goes through the mountains and the speed limit is 60mph, it might be worth taking a more indirect, longer route where speed limit is 80mph. Decisions like this are made possible with data provided from real user cases.
